          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello there! I'm a passionate undergraduate student at the
            University of Colorado Boulder, majoring in Creative & Technology
            Design with the graduating class of 2024. Originally hailing from
            vibrant Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, my journey in the realm of UX/UI
            design has been a captivating exploration of the intersection
            between technology and human experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Passionate about crafting accessible and visually captivating design
            solutions that enhance the user experience. With a relentless
            commitment to user-centered design principles, I strive to create
            intuitive and engaging interfaces that leave a lasting impression.
            My journey as a UX/UI designer is marked by a dedication to
            understanding user needs, empathizing with their perspectives, and
            translating those insights into seamless and aesthetically pleasing
            digital experiences.
