          <h2>What is Universal Design?</h2>
          <p>
            Universal Design is the design and composition of an environment so
            that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent
            possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or
            disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in
            that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people
            who wish to use it. This is not a special requirement, for the
            benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental
            condition of good design. If an environment is accessible, usable,
            convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits. By considering
            the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design
            process, universal design creates products, services and
            environments that meet peoples' needs. Simply put, universal design
            is good design.
