          <h2>What is Universal Design?</h2>
          <p>
            Universal Design is the design and composition of an environment so
            that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent
            possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or
            disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in
            that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people
            who wish to use it. This is not a special requirement, for the
            benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental
            condition of good design. If an environment is accessible, usable,
            convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits. By considering
            the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design
            process, universal design creates products, services and
            environments that meet peoples' needs. Simply put, universal design
            is good design.

        <section id="why">
          <h2>Why accessibility?</h2>
          <p>
            Practicing universal design in web development and design is not
            just a good practiceâ€”it's a game-changer. Here are some compelling
            reasons why you should jump on the universal design bandwagon:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The internet is for everyone, and so should be your website or
              application. Universal design ensures that people of all
              abilities, ages, and backgrounds can access and use your digital
              creations.
            </li>
            <li>
              rends come and go, but inclusivity is timeless. Universal design
              anticipates and accommodates a diverse range of user needs, making
              your creations more resilient to technological shifts and evolving
              user expectations.
            </li>
            <li>
              When your design is accessible to everyone, the overall user
              experience improves. Users with disabilities, as well as those
              using different devices or in various environments, will have a
              seamless and enjoyable interaction with your content.
