          <h2>What is Universal Design?</h2>
          <p>
            Universal Design is the design and composition of an environment so
            that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent
            possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or
            disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in
            that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people
            who wish to use it. This is not a special requirement, for the
            benefit of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental
            condition of good design. If an environment is accessible, usable,
            convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits. By considering
            the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design
            process, universal design creates products, services and
            environments that meet peoples' needs. Simply put, universal design
            is good design. (<a

          <h2>History of Universal Design</h2>
          <h3>Disability-Specific Design</h3>
          <p>
            As the social movements of the 20th Century were gathering momentum
            and new laws served to promote social inclusion and prevent
            discrimination, pressure was placed on the design industry to meet
            the demands of creating accessible and usable products, services and
            environments. The design industry responded with targeted efforts.
            Concepts such as barrier-free design, which aspired to remove
            barriers for disabled people from the built environment, appeared.
            The more generalised concept of “accessible design” emerged in the
            1970s and promoted the incorporation of accessible solutions into
            the general design of products, services and environments.
          </p>
          <h3>Assistive Technology</h3>
          <p>
            At the same time that the mainstream design industry was evolving,
            the parallel field of assistive technology strove to provide more
            specialised solutions for people with specific requirements. Add-on
            products, that could make a formerly inaccessible product
            accessible, were more commonly developed and became more readily
            available.
          </p>
          <h3>Human-Centred Design and Human Factors</h3>
          <p>
            Of major influence in the development of Universal Design were
            design approaches that considered the needs of users from the very
            beginning of the design process. The concept of making a physical
            alteration to an object to suit a person's needs dates back to early
            man when materials such as animal bones were first used to create
            tools. Fields such as Human Factors, Ergonomics and other functional
            design approaches look at the physical anatomy and the behaviour of
            the person and use this information to create designs that fit.
            These design approaches have been of particular interest for health
            and safety reasons, for example the layout of controls for the
            operation of potentially dangerous machinery. More recently the term
            human-centred design is used to describe design that identifies and
            addresses the needs, abilities and limitations of the user.
          </p>
          <h3>Co-design/Participatory Design</h3>
          <p>
            Co-Design is an approach to design that actively involves all
            stakeholders in the design process to help ensure that the result
            meets their needs and is usable. Also referred to as participatory
            design, at the heart of this understanding is the notion that we
            should therefore not be designing for people, but rather, designing
            with them.
          </p>
          <h3>Merging Design Fields</h3>
          <p>
            Combining and drawing from developments in all the above fields, the
            concept of Universal Design was introduced and has developed and
            progressed over the years.
