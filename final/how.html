          <h2>Accessibility cheatsheet</h2>
          <h3>Use semantic HTML</h3>
          <p>
            Semantic HTML helps screenreader users to understand the contents
            structure and gives it meaning. Ask yourself "What is it?" when
            writing HTML. Use a logical headline order and structuring elements
            as header, footer, ul, p …
          </p>
          <h3>Add labels to form elements</h3>
          <p>
            Form input elements need "linked labels" for screenreaders access
          </p>
          <h3>Use contrasting colors</h3>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="contrast.png"
              alt="color contrast right and wrong guideline" />
            <figcaption>Contrasting colors</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h3>Write descriptive links</h3>
          <figure>
            <img src="links.png" alt="how to approach descriptive links" />
            <figcaption>Descriptive links</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h3>Provide text for non-text content</h3>
          <p>
            Every content not represented by text is invisbible for screen
            readers. Provide concise descriptions in alt attributes for all
            content images and text alternatives for charts etc. CAPTCHAs also
            need to be accessible.
          </p>
          <h3>Keep pinch and zoom alive</h3>
          <p>
            Pinching to zoom is very common and helps aging and low vision
            users. Avoid user-scalable= "no" and maximum-scale: 1 at any cost.
          </p>
          <h3>Show where your :focus is</h3>
          <p>
            Navigating by keyboard needs the currently focused element to be
            visibly highlighted. Interactive elements should get focused in a
            useful order and be focusable by default. Avoid span and div.
          </p>
          <h3>Understandable without color</h3>
          <p>
            Colors should not be necessary to understand the content and its
            current state. For example don’t highlight errors just with red
            text. Add a subsidiary icon.
          </p>
          <h3>Caption video and audio</h3>
          <p>
            Provide text alternatives for audio and video content. Captions
            should be made available with pre-recorded and live video/audio
            content. Voice recognition software can help create captions for
            some type of videos.
          </p>
          <h3>Use WAI-ARIA only if necessary</h3>
          <p>
            Dynamic sites such as single page applications tend to get
            complicated when it comes to accessibility. Semantic HTML should
            always be considered before using
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">WAI-ARIA</a>.

        <h2>Universal Design Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Application of a Universal Design Approach can complement any design
          process by prioritising design activities that enable an organisation
          to extend their range of users by identifying diverse user needs,
          characteristics, capabilities, and preferences; by directly or
          indirectly involving users; and by using knowledge about accessibility
          in its procedures and processes. A resource for organisations is the
          standard EN 17161. Standardised across Europe, “EN 17161:2019 Design
          for All - Accessibility following a Design for All approach in
          products, goods and services - Extending the range of users’ is a
          process standard about using a Universal Design approach at all levels
          in organisations to continuously improve and manage the accessibility
          and usability of the products and services they provide. Stories from
          ALONE and Dolmen as Early Adopters of EN 17161 is in a webinar. Also
          find, two publications about implementing Universal Design guidance
          and accessibility standards for continuous improvement and informing
          procurement activities at ALONE. EN 17161 is part of a suite of
          standards that can be used by organisations to demonstrate their
          conformance with the European Accessibility Act (EAA) that requires
          some products and services to be accessible. The European Commission
          issued a Standardisation Request (SR), M/587, in 2022 to European
          standards bodies to develop a number of standards in support of the
          DIRECTIVE (EU) 2019/882. In collaboration with the National Standards
          Authority Ireland (NSAI) the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design
          is participating in the development and revision of these standards
          within the scope of the EAA.
