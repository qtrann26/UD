          <p>
            Practicing universal design in web development and design is not
            just a good practiceâ€”it's a game-changer. Here are some compelling
            reasons why you should jump on the universal design bandwagon:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The internet is for everyone, and so should be your website or
              application. Universal design ensures that people of all
              abilities, ages, and backgrounds can access and use your digital
              creations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Trends come and go, but inclusivity is timeless. Universal design
              anticipates and accommodates a diverse range of user needs, making
              your creations more resilient to technological shifts and evolving
              user expectations.
            </li>
            <li>
              When your design is accessible to everyone, the overall user
              experience improves. Users with disabilities, as well as those
              using different devices or in various environments, will have a
              seamless and enjoyable interaction with your content.
