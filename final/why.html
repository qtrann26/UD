          <h2>Why should we practice Universal Design?</h2>
          <p>
            Practicing universal design in web development and design is not
            just a good practiceâ€”it's a game-changer. Here are some compelling
            reasons why you should jump on the universal design bandwagon:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The internet is for everyone, and so should be your website or
              application. Universal design ensures that people of all
              abilities, ages, and backgrounds can access and use your digital
              creations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Trends come and go, but inclusivity is timeless. Universal design
              anticipates and accommodates a diverse range of user needs, making
              your creations more resilient to technological shifts and evolving
              user expectations.
            </li>
            <li>
              When your design is accessible to everyone, the overall user
              experience improves. Users with disabilities, as well as those
              using different devices or in various environments, will have a
              seamless and enjoyable interaction with your content.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Benefits of Universal Design</h2>
          <p>
            The case for making our society more universally accessible and
            usable to all is compelling on many fronts. Universal Design
            proposes a progressive and evolving approach to the development of
            inclusive environments that can be accessed, understood and used to
            the greatest extent possible. Not only does Universal Design make
            good business sense, it also has many compelling social and legal
            drivers.
          </p>
          <h3>Benefits to the Individual</h3>
          <p>
            The human-centred approach to design that Universal Design supports
            is user-friendly and convenient, but is also respectful of user
            dignity, rights and privacy. The degree of difficulty that people
            experience when using a product, service or environment can vary,
            such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A person who has no significant problems but who would appreciate
              a well-designed accessible and usable product, service or
              environment
            </li>
            <li>A person who has little difficulty with all features</li>
            <li>A person who has difficulty with some features</li>
            <li>A person who has trouble with most features</li>
            <li>A person who is unable to use the product/service at all.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Social Benefits of Universal Design for a Changing World</h3>
          <p>
            The age-distribution of the world's population is changing
            dramatically. People are living longer as a result of medical
            innovations and healthier lifestyle changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the coming decades in Europe and Ireland, the number of
            people who are available and capable of assisting and caring for
            older people will decrease considerably. While the number of people
            living with physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual and
            neuro diverse conditions is increasing, as is the life expectancy of
            people with particularly severe or multiple impairments.

        <section id="compliance">
          <h2>Compliance with Legislation and Standards</h2>
          <p>
            Standards and guidelines provide practical guidance on how to comply
            with legislation. The specifications and minimum requirements
            provided in standards and guidelines often include accessibility and
            usability recommendations. So, with regard to the design of a
            product, service or environment, Universal Design is an approach
            that not only promotes compliance but has much wider potential for
            improving accessibility and usability, beyond the minimum
            requirements enforced by law.
